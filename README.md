## Summary
Planning and execution on using AI to generate witness and client interviews for law student to practice interviewing.
Final project for the Building AI course.

I teach at a U.S. law school.  Our students need to learn the essential skills involved in interviewing witnesses (and clients and others).  Unfortunately, most of our teaching has always been in the form of book learning, instead of skill learning.  This focus on transmitting intellectual knowlege rather than skills comes from many influences.  One big barrier to teaching skills, however, is that skills require practice, and practice requires setting up many opportunities.  We don't have 100 actors ready to play witnesses, and ready to give feedback about those practice sessions. Teaching interviewing, however, has become much more of a priority becuase it is now part of the bar exam for new lawyers.  We need to figure out how to expose 180 students each year to the fundamentals of interviewing by setting up practice scenarios.  AI can help us solve the problem of finding practice opportunities.

## How is it used?

The project would be deployed as stand-alone modules associated with required classes.  It should be suitable for first and second year law students.

## Data sources and AI methods

This is an entirely language-based problem, so we would be looking to work with the deep learning systems capable of working with English-langauge inputs.  I would be generating the basics of the problem.  We would use caselaw to provide a set of legal parameters that would be invovled in each problem.
The students would be doing the interviewing.  At the lower level, they would be using a written input to pose questions to the "witness".  At a more advanced stage, students may be asked to use oral questions, with spoken answers from the "witness" so as to mimic a real time interview process.

## What next?

I am a subject matter expert on law and investigations, not a data scientist.  I need to understand how to pull a project like this together, how to guard against abuse and other mischief while using AI, and how to shape the prompts.
